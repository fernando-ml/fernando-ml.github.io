Deep reinforcement learning agents often face challenges to effectively coordinate perception and decision-making components, particularly in environments with high-dimensional sensory inputs where feature relevance varies. This work introduces SPRIG (Stackelberg Perception-Reinforcement learning with Internal Game dynamics), a framework that models the internal perception-policy interaction within a single agent as a cooperative Stackelberg game. In SPRIG, the perception module acts as a leader, strategically processing raw sensory states, while the policy module follows, making decisions based on extracted features. SPRIG provides theoretical guarantees through a modified Bellman operator while preserving the benefits of modern policy optimization. Experimental results on the Atari BeamRider environment demonstrate SPRIG's effectiveness, achieving around 30% higher returns than standard PPO through its game-theoretical balance of feature extraction and decision-making.
